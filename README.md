The Experis Pattern Library (XPL) is a living style guide and a component-driven, front-end development resource. It strives to provide auto-generated documentation and reference as well as a development environment for creating highly organized and efficient websites.

* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) (requires [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)): Enter `gem install compass` from a command prompt.
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): Enter `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
* [Bower](http://bower.io/): Enter `npm install -g bower`.

## Quick Installation
