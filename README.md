# Experis Pattern Library

The Experis Pattern Library (XPL) is a living style guide and a component-driven, front-end development resource. It strives to provide auto-generated documentation and reference as well as a development environment for creating highly organized and efficient websites.

## Requirements
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)

## Quick Installation
1. Download and install Node.js.
2. Install Compass (requires Ruby) by running `gem install compass` from a command line.
3. Install Grunt by running `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
4. Install Bower by running `npm install -g bower`.
5. Open a command prompt and change to the directory containing this file.
6. Run `npm install` to retrieve necessary development dependencies.
7. Run `bower install` to retrieve project dependencies.

## Getting Started

From a command line, change to the directory containing this file, and run `grunt serve`. This will open the Introduction page of the pattern library. Edit the files in the **app** directory, and watch as the pattern library stays up to date with your changes.

When finished, run `grunt` to create a **dist** directory containing optimized scripts and CSS, ready for deployment.
