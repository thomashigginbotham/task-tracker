# Task Tracker

Task Tracker is a web application that provides simple project management and time tracking. It is built with the Experis Pattern Library and Polymer.

In the current phase, I am building out static pages using Polymer components. When complete, functionality will be added using AngularJS on the front end and ASP.NET MVC on the back end.

The Experis Pattern Library (XPL) is a living style guide and a component-driven, front-end development resource. It strives to provide auto-generated documentation and reference as well as a development environment for creating highly organized and efficient websites.

## Requirements
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/): Download and run the installer.
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) (requires [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)): Enter `gem install compass` from a command prompt.
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): Enter `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
* [Bower](http://bower.io/): Enter `npm install -g bower`.

## Quick Installation
1. Open a command prompt and change to the directory containing this file.
2. Run `npm install` to retrieve necessary development dependencies.
3. Run `bower install` to retrieve project dependencies.

## Getting Started

From a command line, change to the directory containing this file, and run `grunt serve`. This will open the Introduction page of the pattern library. Edit the files in the **app** directory, and watch as the pattern library stays up to date with your changes.

When finished, run `grunt` to create a **dist** directory containing optimized scripts and CSS, ready for deployment.
